## HTML

Every website is made up of HTML elements. Right click on any web page, and select "Inspect." This will open up your browser's development tools, select the "Elements" tab.

Here you can see the structure of the elements on the page. These can be written directly, generated using JavaScript, or another templating language.

Each element has semantic meaning. For example, the `p` tag, represents a paragraph. These elements have a unique purpose, and you should strive to use the best element for the content you are displaying. By doing this---using "semantic HTML"---your sites will be more accessible, as these elements are helpful for people who use screen readers.
