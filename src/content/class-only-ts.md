## Benefits of using classes for everything in ts

- Declaration merging
- Private vars
- static methods that can use the private vars
- Use class as the type

Remove `draft: true` from frontmatter to include in the final build.

have a namespace the same name as a type so that you can add other types to it that look like properties but also use it as the actual type
